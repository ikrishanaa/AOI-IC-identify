Create WARP.md at the repository root with the exact content below
Confirm creation and basic formatting
I'll create a concise WARP.md at the repository root that reflects the current blueprint-only state, captures commands explicitly shown in the blueprint (docker compose, uvicorn services, Celery worker, pytest usage), enumerates required environment variables, and summarizes the big-picture architecture (two operational modes, microservices, multi-signal pipeline, and data persistence). Then I’ll verify the file exists and starts with the required header lines.

Proceeding to write the file to your repository now.
Completed Confirm creation and basic formatting
Created WARP.md at /home/krishana/Videos/AOI-IC-identify/WARP.md

What I did:
•  Analyzed the repository: it currently contains only BLUEPRINT documents and no implemented code, README, tests, or existing WARP.md.
•  Authored a concise WARP.md that:
◦  Starts with the required header.
◦  Lists commonly used commands explicitly present in the blueprint (docker compose, uvicorn for services, Celery worker, pytest usage).
◦  Enumerates required environment variables from the blueprint.
◦  Summarizes the big-picture architecture (batch vs live modes, microservices, multi-signal pipeline, data persistence).
◦  Avoids generic dev practices and file-by-file listings.

Key repo findings that informed the content:
•  Files present: BLUEPRINT/Blueprint_sih-ps2.md (detailed architecture blueprint).
•  No README.md, CLI rules files, or implemented code.

Highlights of WARP.md content:
•  Commands
◦  Container:
▪  docker compose build
▪  docker compose up -d
◦  Local backend (non-container):
▪  uvicorn inspection_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
▪  uvicorn stream_ingestion_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
▪  celery -A batch_processing_service.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
◦  Testing (per blueprint proposal):
▪  pytest backend/tests -q
▪  pytest backend/tests/test_batch_processing_service.py -q
▪  pytest path/to/test_file.py::TestClass::test_func -q
•  Environment variables
◦  DATABASE_URL, CELERY_BROKER_URL, CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND, NEXAR_API_KEY, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
•  Architecture (big picture)
◦  Batch mode: async via Celery + Redis; persistence in PostgreSQL; audit trail.
◦  Live mode: real-time via WebSockets; snapshot persistence on demand.
◦  Microservices: API Gateway, Inspection Management, Batch Processing (Celery), Stream Ingestion & Processing, Component Verification, Decision Engine.
◦  Multi-signal pipeline: Preprocessing → ROI → OCR → Logo ID → Visual Signature embeddings → Surface Anomaly → Decision Engine fusion.
◦  Data persistence: PostgreSQL, snapshotting in live mode, immutable audit via shadow tables + triggers.

Verification:
•  Confirmed the file exists and the header lines are exactly:
◦  # WARP.md
◦  This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

Would you like me to:
•  Open a quick diff to show the new file?
•  Commit the WARP.md to your repo with a conventional message?
~/Videos/AOI-IC-identify
first of all read the blueprint and break the entire blueprint in high level milestones in a milestones.md file and guide yourself in a step wise organised manner. also create a progress tracker markdown file that keeps updating as we move forward.
start building the webapp foundations from scratch. 
P I will:
•  Create a structured todo plan to manage this multi-step task efficiently.
•  Write MILESTONES.md derived from your blueprint so future work is organized.
•  Add a PROGRESS.md tracker to update as we complete milestones.
•  Scaffold backend foundations (FastAPI services, Celery, tests), plus a dev Dockerfile and docker-compose.
•  Scaffold a minimal Next.js frontend.

Proceeding to create the plan and files now.
Synthesize blueprint into milestones and author MILESTONES.md
Create PROGRESS.md tracker
Scaffold backend foundation
Add dev Dockerfile and docker-compose for core services
Scaffold minimal frontend foundation
Update PROGRESS.md after scaffolding
I’m going to create the milestones and progress tracker files, then scaffold the backend, Docker setup, and a minimal frontend. I’ll do this by writing new files directly into your repository so you can start using them immediately.
Completed Synthesize blueprint into milestones and author MILESTONES.md (1/6)
Completed Create PROGRESS.md tracker (4/6), Scaffold minimal frontend foundation (5/6), Update PROGRESS.md after scaffolding (6/6)
Done. Here’s what I created and why, plus how to run and next steps.

What I added
•  MILESTONES.md
◦  High-level, stepwise plan distilled from your blueprint with scope, dependencies, and “done when” criteria for each milestone (M0–M12).
◦  Location: /home/krishana/Videos/AOI-IC-identify/MILESTONES.md
•  PROGRESS.md
◦  A concise tracker with statuses, next actions, and a dated changelog entry. It’s already updated to reflect the scaffolding I added in this pass.
◦  Location: /home/krishana/Videos/AOI-IC-identify/PROGRESS.md
•  Backend foundations (FastAPI + Celery)
◦  Shared settings: backend/shared/config.py
◦  Services (each with /health):
▪  backend/api_gateway/main.py
▪  backend/inspection_service/main.py
▪  backend/decision_engine/main.py
▪  backend/verification_service/main.py
▪  backend/stream_ingestion_service/main.py (includes stub /live/feed and a WebSocket stub at /ws/live/analysis)
◦  Celery:
▪  backend/batch_processing_service/celery_app.py (configured from env)
▪  backend/batch_processing_service/tasks.py (ping/add and process_inspection_image stub)
◦  Tests:
▪  backend/tests/conftest.py (import path fix)
▪  backend/tests/test_health_endpoints.py (health checks for all services)
▪  backend/pytest.ini (quiet output)
◦  Env and dependencies:
▪  backend/.env.example
▪  backend/requirements.txt
◦  Dev Dockerfile:
▪  backend/Dockerfile
•  Docker Compose (dev)
◦  docker-compose.yml includes postgres, redis, api_gateway, inspection_service, batch_worker, stream_ingestion_service, decision_engine, verification_service
•  Minimal Next.js frontend scaffold
◦  frontend/package.json, next.config.js, tsconfig.json, next-env.d.ts
◦  frontend/app/layout.tsx, frontend/app/page.tsx

How to run (local, non-container)
•  Python venv and deps:
◦  python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
◦  pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
•  Run a service (example):
◦  uvicorn backend/api_gateway/main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
•  Run Celery worker:
◦  celery -A backend.batch_processing_service.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
•  Run tests:
◦  pytest backend/tests -q

How to run (Docker Compose)
•  docker compose build
•  docker compose up -d
•  Services:
◦  API Gateway: http://localhost:8003/health
◦  Inspection: http://localhost:8001/health
◦  Stream: http://localhost:8002/health
◦  Decision Engine: http://localhost:8004/health
◦  Verification: http://localhost:8005/health

Notes and suggestions
•  WARP.md currently reads “blueprints only.” Since we’ve scaffolded code, I can update WARP.md to reflect the new repo state and include compose/run instructions for these services. Want me to update it?
•  Postgres credentials in docker-compose are for local dev only. You can place real env values in a .env file and mount via env_file if you prefer.

Proposed next actions (aligned to MILESTONES.md)
•  M3 Database: Add SQLAlchemy models (inspection_jobs, inspection_results) and a simple DB connectivity check endpoint.
•  M4 Batch MVP: Implement POST /inspections to enqueue process_inspection_image and GET /inspections/{id} (mocked status/result).
•  M5 Decision Engine v0: Implement /decide with simple weighted rules and tests.

If you want, I can proceed directly with M3 by adding models, a DB session helper, and a simple health/db endpoint to confirm connectivity.

before moving forward, fix this minor git issue:

" Make sure you configure your "user.name" and "user.erm" in git. "
username is ikrishanaa and email is krishanaindia773@gmail.com
P I will run terminal commands to configure Git’s global user.name and user.email with your provided values, then verify they were set correctly. This will resolve the commit warning you’ve been seeing.
•  git config user.email "krishanaindia773@gmail.com"

Want me to set the repo-local values as well?
I’m going to:
•  Add a local development guide so you can run and view the app on localhost.
•  Create a .gitignore tailored to this Python/Next.js/Docker project and include the guide in it as requested.
•  Proceed with the next milestone (M3): add database foundation (SQLAlchemy engine, minimal models, DB health check, and debug create/read endpoints).
•  Update the progress tracker.

What I changed
•  LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md
◦  How to run with Docker Compose and how to run infra (postgres/redis) in containers while running services locally.
◦  Where to see each backend service on localhost (health, WS stub, feed stub).
◦  How to start the Next.js dev server at http://localhost:3000.
◦  Data persistence checks via debug endpoints in the Inspection service.
•  .gitignore
◦  Added standard Python, Node/Next.js, env, Docker, and editor ignores.
◦  Per your request, LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md is ignored too.
•  Database foundation (Milestone M3)
◦  backend/shared/db.py: SQLAlchemy engine/session/Base and a connection checker.
◦  backend/inspection_service/models.py: Minimal models (inspection_jobs, inspection_results).
◦  backend/inspection_service/main.py:
▪  Creates tables at startup (dev convenience).
▪  /db/health endpoint verifies DB connectivity.
▪  /debug/jobs: POST creates a stub job; GET fetches a job by id.
•  Progress updated
◦  PROGRESS.md: Marked M3 as DONE and added a changelog entry.

How to use it now
•  With Docker Compose:
◦  docker compose build
◦  docker compose up -d
◦  Health endpoints:
▪  API Gateway: http://localhost:8003/health
▪  Inspection: http://localhost:8001/health
▪  Stream: http://localhost:8002/health
▪  Decision: http://localhost:8004/health
▪  Verification: http://localhost:8005/health
◦  DB check: http://localhost:8001/db/health
◦  Create job: POST http://localhost:8001/debug/jobs
◦  Get job: GET http://localhost:8001/debug/jobs/{id}
◦  Live WS stub: ws://localhost:8002/ws/live/analysis
•  Frontend (local dev):
◦  cd frontend && npm install
◦  npm run dev
◦  Open http://localhost:3000

Next step proposal (Milestone M4)
•  Implement the MVP batch flow:
◦  POST /inspections (create job + enqueue process_inspection_image)
◦  GET /inspections/{id} (mocked status/result storage for now)
•  Then Milestone M5: Decision Engine v0 endpoint with simple weighted rules + tests.

Would you like me to proceed with M4 now (enqueue + status endpoints) and wire it into docker-compose and the frontend mock pages?
I tried to run the environment bring-up, but your system is missing required tooling:

•  docker: not installed
•  npm: not installed
•  pip: not installed

I can proceed in one of the following ways. Tell me which you prefer, and I’ll run the commands for you.

Option A (recommended): Install Docker + Compose and run the full stack
•  This will start Postgres, Redis, and all backend services in containers.
•  Commands I will run:
◦  sudo apt update
◦  sudo apt install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin
◦  sudo systemctl enable --now docker
◦  sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"  (you’ll need to log out/in for group to apply; I can still use sudo docker now)
◦  sudo docker compose build
◦  sudo docker compose up -d
◦  sudo docker compose ps

Option B: Install Node and start the frontend locally
•  This will get the Next.js dev server running at http://localhost:3000.
•  Commands I will run:
◦  sudo apt update
◦  sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
◦  npm install --prefix ./frontend
◦  npm run dev --prefix ./frontend

Option C: Install Python pip to run backend services locally (limited)
•  We can run stateless FastAPI services (api_gateway, decision_engine, verification_service, stream_ingestion_service). The inspection_service requires Postgres and will fail without a DB.
•  Commands I will run:
◦  sudo apt update
◦  sudo apt install -y python3-pip
◦  python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
◦  pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
◦  uvicorn backend/api_gateway/main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
◦  uvicorn backend/decision_engine/main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8004 --reload
◦  uvicorn backend/verification_service/main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005 --reload
◦  uvicorn backend/stream_ingestion_service/main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload

Which option should I execute now? If you want the full environment, choose Option A; I can then also start the frontend after that.

See 'docker --help'
Updated WARP.md to reflect the current implemented state.

Changes:
•  Repository status now notes backend scaffolding, frontend, and docker-compose stack.
•  Added compose commands and mapped service URLs:
◦  API Gateway: http://localhost:8003/health
◦  Inspection: http://localhost:8001/health, /db/health
◦  Stream: http://localhost:8002/health, ws://localhost:8002/ws/live/analysis
◦  Decision: http://localhost:8004/health
◦  Verification: http://localhost:8005/health
•  Added frontend dev steps (npm install, npm run dev at http://localhost:3000).
•  Updated local uvicorn commands to use backend/ paths and ports.
•  Testing section points to backend/tests/test_health_endpoints.py and shows single-test invocation.
•  Containerization footprint summarizes services and ports.

Proceed to M4 (enqueue + status endpoints) and wire a simple frontend page to exercise them?
